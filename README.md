## Features
**Adding a Note**

To add a new note, click on the "New Note" button at the bottom of the screen. This will open a form where you can enter a title, tagline, and body for your note. Once you have entered your information, click the "Save" button to save your note.

**Editing a Note**
  -
To edit an existing note, click on the note you want to edit in the grid layout. This will open a form with the existing title, tagline, and body filled in. You can make changes to any of these fields and then click the "Save" button to update your note.

**Pinning a Note**
  -
To pin a note, click on the pin icon on the top right corner of the note. Pinned notes will always appear at the top of the grid layout, regardless of when they were created or last edited.

To navigate between pages, use the pagination buttons at the bottom of the screen. Each page can contain a maximum of 6 notes.

**Deployment**
